Features

### Run locally
The following instructions are Ubuntu but similar actions are needed in all operating systems. 
 
In order to run locally you will need to 
- clone the repo 
- run npm install (assuming node, npm and bower are already installed) 
- a web server like apache
- php
- mod_php module for apache 
- ensure the php user e.g. www-data has write permission to the `app/data` directory

Also a vhost entry for apache, you will then need to enable the new site by typing `sudo a2ensite my-contacts` as well as  
add an entry under `/etc/hosts` for `my-contacts.local`, then restart `sudo service apache2 restrt` 
and then navigate to [http://my-contacts.local](http://my-contacts.local) and if everything went smoothly 
you should be able to see the contact list.
